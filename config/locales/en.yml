  about_services_analysis_title: "Analysis"  
  about_services_analysis_details: "We start by making a situation analysis together in order to build a detailed working plan, with project flows, focusing on the critical points. Sometimes these analyses need us to acquire operational knowhow about the framework used by the client. At the end of this stage, we share the analysis’ results by means of several project documents, concise but detailed, also according to the UML (Unified Modeling Language) standard."
  about_services_development_title: "Development"
  about_services_development_details: "Following the analysis, we start developing the solution. If convenient, we refer to software components by other producers in order to speed and standardize the process according to well-established practices in the best software development communities. We often get direct Microsoft support, being one of their certified partners. At this stage some meetings are planned to assess the consistency of what has been developed and verify how the project is progressing."

Possible changes in our clients’ business flows may require product adjustments, even structural ones. Designing a custom solution also means implement the best integrated product with the existing environment, in order to minimize maintenance interventions."

Since then we have developed more than 80 sites, all of them different, but having the same purpose: to provide a high-quality browsing experience. Our dynamic websites come with an open-source content management system, which makes our clients autonomous as for upgrading, without being dependent on us forever. Our dynamic websites are designed with a search engine friendly architecture, which makes them ideal for businesses that require search engine visibility. In more than 10 years we have developed thematic portals, online order management intranets and extranets, e-commerce sites integrated with management information systems, and mobile services and applications for portable devices."
