  title_about: "SPOT Software - About us"
  meta_description_about: "We design and develop custom software in order to create integration solutions and dynamic websites."
  about_title: "About"
  about_team_kind: "We are a deft and passionate team, with a variety of skills and competences."
  about_work_kind: "We design and develop custom software in order to create integration solutions and dynamic websites."
  about_work_history: "Thanks to our over 15 years of active presence on the market, we have learned to create low-cost but state-of-the-art software, and usable but graphically appealing websites with high search engine visibility."
  about_beliefs: "We strongly believe in the quality of our team and its up-to-date expertise. We think that having the right people with the right tools and skills is the best starting point for a mutually satisfactory relationship with our clients."
  about_services_analysis_title: "Analysis"  
  about_services_analysis_details: "We start by making a situation analysis together in order to build a detailed working plan, with project flows, focusing on the critical points. Sometimes these analyses need us to acquire operational knowhow about the framework used by the client. At the end of this stage, we share the analysis’ results by means of several project documents, concise but detailed, also according to the UML (Unified Modeling Language) standard."
  about_services_development_title: "Development"
  about_services_development_details: "Following the analysis, we start developing the solution. If convenient, we refer to software components by other producers in order to speed and standardize the process according to well-established practices in the best software development communities. We often get direct Microsoft support, being one of their certified partners. At this stage some meetings are planned to assess the consistency of what has been developed and verify how the project is progressing."
  about_services_test_title: "Testing"
  about_services_test_details: "After a formal approval of the project by the client, a testing stage follows: the final software applications are tried out in simulated operative conditions. The tests will be approved by the project manager, and later by a team specialized in software products validation."
  about_services_deployment_title: "Deployment"
  about_services_deployment_details: "Having stood the internal tests, a deployment stage starts. Web projects are published online. If required, specific tools and procedures can be developed for an autonomous installation of the product by the client. Of course, we will stay in close contact should there be any problem in the adjustment to the client hardware requirements."
  about_services_maintenance_title: "Maintenance"
  about_services_maintenance_details: "Thanks to the modularity of the projects, it is easy to carry out adaptive maintenance and enhancement. Possible changes in our clients’ business flows may require product adjustments, even structural ones. Designing a custom solution also means implement the best integrated product with the existing environment, in order to minimize maintenance interventions."

  services_mobile_title: "Mobile"
  services_mobile_description: "We've been developing applications for mobile devices since 2003. Every application takes advantage of the mobile net thanks to different devices like smartphone, tablet and phablet. This context requires applications with high level usability and speed, applications specifically designed for this environment. We are skilled in native apps development for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone platforms. We have also experiences in the development of applications for wearable devices like Google Glass, Pebble SmartWatch, etc"
  services_custom_projects_title: "Custom projects"
  services_custom_projects_description: "Thanks to over 15 years of experience in development of custom software applications, we have explored multiple operative fields and invariably reached our goals. One of the areas in which we work more often is the integration of diversified information systems, produced by other software companies or operating on different databases. Thus we deal with other software producers in order to find the most functional and economically convenient solution for our clients. We also put particular care in developing the user interface, so that our software products are both graphically appealing and easy to use."
  services_web_title: "Web"
  services_web_description: "Among the first in Italy, in 1999 we realized an online order management system for a catering company. Since then we have developed more than 80 sites, all of them different, but having the same purpose: to provide a high-quality browsing experience.  We use the most spread and up to date technology and languages, server side and client side, C#, ASP.NET, Ruby on Rails, and the most commons javascript frameworks: JQuery, AngularJS, NodeJS, Knockout and of course HTML5 and CSS3 to manage web sites with responsive layout for different screen resolutions on different devices. In more than 10 years we have developed thematic portals, online order management intranets and extranets, e-commerce sites integrated with management information systems, and mobile services and applications for portable devices."

    # ==> Google Glass

    googleglass:
      title: "Our experiences with Google Glass"
      arentgadget: "Google Glass is not a \"gadget\" that leaves you cold: from the start, when Google Glass prototypes were initially released, they became objects of desire."
      consultant:
        before: "Thanks to our consultant, Kevin Gaugler, lecturer and expert in \"new learning technologies\" at"
        after: "in the US, we were entered into the Google Glass Explorer Program."
      waitingended: "The wait ended in the first week of December, 2013: our curiosity was piqued and we immediately wanted to experiment with the device. The initial impact of the user interface and the voice command interface was not an instant one, but the trouble lasted only a few hours."
      workonsdk: "Given our approach to development, we immediately set to work with the SDK on the Eclipse IDE for our first tests."
      experiments: "The first technical tests went swimmingly, with tests of its potential both in the office and outside. One thing was clear immediately: Google Glass definitely attracts the attention of others."
      applications: "We found some of the first applications available—particularly simultaneous translation of texts directly on the display—impressive, confirming the potential of the device."
      prototypesdevelopment: "After making ourselves familiar with the SDK, we started developing some prototype apps for our clients in the fitness sector, which led us to building a module for integrating Glass with a treadmill."
      enthusiasm: "The enthusiasm for this tool has even made it a lead actor in Christmas greetings videos; a goal sadly ruined by the breaking of the display and the need to face the initial problems with the Glass hardware. In this case, despite the device's prototype nature, Google's support still rose to the challenge, allowing us to replace the device within a reasonable time."
      aspects:
        title: "During our experience developing with the SDK, we gained deep insight into the following features:"
        bluetoothcommunication: "Bi-directional Bluetooth communication"
        voicecommands: "Extension of vocal commands"
        operationalflow: "Operational flow control"
      problems:
        autonomy: "During our daily use, the only issue we've noticed with Google Glass is battery life, as well as a certain level of curiosity from those who see you wearing one!"
      platformsintegration: "The device's integration with the Android platform is excellent, but some problems remain with integration and development on the iOS platform."
      github:
        title: "You can find some sample code in our public GitHub repository, based on the applications we have developed:"
        bluetoothexample: "Bluetooth example"
        voicecommandsexample: "Voice Command example"
        slideshowexample: "SlideShow example"
      conclusions: "Our experience and exploration of the Glass product has been entirely positive and continues to this day. We are deliberately setting aside the issues surrounding privacy, wearability or the attention it attracts, which have all been covered in endless articles and debates online."
      considerations: "We are limiting ourselves to highlighting an interesting article that investigates the cost of the components used to build each Google Glass, providing an estimate of how much the retail price of the device will be; another topic receiving much discussion in recent months."
